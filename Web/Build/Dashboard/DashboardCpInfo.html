        <span id="ui-id-1">Commercial Performance Curves: Guidance of Technical Superintendents</span>
    </div>
    <p>Commercial Performance provides Trend & digital information from noon reports on comparison of actual operating speed, and fuel consumption with the Charter Party requirements under ballast and laden condition.</p>
    <p>One of the most commonly encountered disputes between owners and charterers relates to the fuel consumption and vessel’s speed whilst under time charter.</p>
    <p>Commercial Performance graphs can provide clarity to help Technical Supdt attend to claims by comparing expected to actual fuel consumption for a given speed.</p>
    <p>Commercial Performance graphs monitor deviations by comparing expected to actual fuel consumption and speed, to provide an alarm to alert Technical Supdt in case of excessive differences.</p>
    <p>If the wind force is greater than Beaufort (BF) 4, greater than Charter Party condition, the vessel is not governed by Charter Party Speed and consumption for conditions exceeding the wind force stipulated in the Charter Party (BF 4 as in NYPE 2015), and hence can’t be held liable for under performance of speed or excess oil consumption during operations in such conditions.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>NYPE 2015, TIME CHARTER PARTY</strong>, EXPLANATORY NOTES
        <br><strong>Clause 12 (Speed and Consumption)</strong>
        <br>NYPE 2015 incorporates a new clause dealing with speed and consumption obligations and claims.
    </p>
    <p><span class="pointsHiLighter">a</span> Upon delivery and throughout the duration of this Charter Party the Vessel shall be <strong>capable of speed and daily consumption rates</strong> as stated in Appendix A in good weather on all sea passages with <strong style="color: red;">wind up to and including Force four (4)</strong> as per the Beaufort Scale and <strong style="color: rebeccapurple">sea state up to and including Sea State three (3)</strong> as per the Douglas Sea Scale (unless otherwise specified in Appendix A).</p>
    <p>Any period during which the Vessel’s speed is deliberately reduced to comply with the Charterers’ orders/requirements (unless slow steaming or eco speed warranties have been given in Appendix A) or for reasons of safety or while navigating within narrow or restricted waters or when assisting a vessel in distress or when saving or attempting to save life or property at sea, shall be excluded from performance calculations.</p>
    <p class="pastExperns">Sub-clause (a) is a continuing warranty by the owners that the ship, as of the date of delivery and throughout the charter period, is capable of performing at the speed and with the fuel consumption set out in Appendix A (Vessel Description).</p>
    <p class="pastExperns">This is new compared to the previous NYPE forms, which had capability warranties (in the Preamble) that applied only on delivery. Because NYPE 2015 contains a slow steaming provision (Clause 38) giving the charterers the right to order the ship to operate at reduced speeds, this clause excludes from performance calculations any periods during which the ship is “slow steaming” under the charterers’ orders (unless Appendix A contains specific warranties for speeds and related daily consumptions for reduced speeds).</p>
    <p><span class="pointsHiLighter">b</span> The Charterers shall have the option of using their <strong style="color: red;">preferred weather routing service</strong>. The Master shall comply with the reporting procedure of the Charterers’ weather routing service and shall follow routing recommendations from that service <strong>provided that the safety of the Vessel and/or cargo is not compromised</strong>.</p>
    <p class="pastExperns"> It is common practice in the industry for time charterers to employ the services of a weather routeing company and so subclause (b) provides that option. Consistent with the “Hill Harmony” judgment, the Master has the right to deviate from the customary or recommended route for reasons of safety of the ship, crew and cargo – but if the weather routeing service provides routeing advice, the Master is otherwise obliged to follow it.</p>
    <p><span class="pointsHiLighter">c</span> The <strong style="color: red;">actual route taken</strong> by the Vessel shall be used as the <strong>basis of any calculation of the Vessel\'s performance.</strong></p>
    <p><span class="pointsHiLighter">d</span> <strong style="color: red;">If the speed of the Vessel is reduced</strong> and/<strong style="color: rebeccapurple;">or fuel oil consumption increased</strong>, the Charterers may submit to the Owners a <strong>documented claim</strong> limited to the <strong>estimated time lost</strong> and/or the <strong>additional fuel consumed</strong>, supported by a performance analysis from the weather routing service established in accordance with this Clause. The <strong>cost of any time lost</strong> shall be <strong>off-set against the cost of any fuel saved</strong> and vice versa.</p>
    <p class="pastExperns">Claims by the charterers are expressly limited to compensation for the time lost as a result of the underperformance or the cost of any additional fuel consumed. Credit is given for under-consumption offset against time lost and vice versa.</p>
    <p><span class="pointsHiLighter">e</span> In the event that the Owners contest such claim then the Owners shall provide copies of the Vessel\'s deck logs for the period concerned and the matter shall be referred to an independent expert or alternative weather service selected by mutual agreement, whose report shall take Vessel’s log data and the Charterers’ weather service data into consideration and whose determination shall be final and binding on the parties. The cost of such expert report shall be shared equally.</p>
    <p class="pastExperns">If there is a dispute over a performance claim the owners and the charterers can refer it to an independent expert for determination. The expert will take into account the ship’s deck logs as evidence and compare it with weather data provided by the routeing service. The use of a mutually agreed expert determination service, whose decision is binding on both parties is intended to help reduce the time and cost involved in performance claims.</p>
    <p class="pastExperns">Note: Nowadays the weather routeing companies use sophisticated software to extrapolate the likely under performance during the weather experienced, to hold the ship to stipulated performance and to assist Charterers claim the “damages” for such under performance from owners.</p>
