    <p><strong>Voyage Overview Curves</strong> provides graphic information on vessel’s progress obtained from the daily noon report. It shows the events that affect operational efficiency and tracks actual voyage execution. Default view is 7 days, but can be selected up to 60 days. Ship staff shall endeavour to operate the vessel in an efficient manner. These curves help in identifying deviations, where corrective measure may be required. </p>

        <strong>Propeller Slip as a weather index</strong>
        <br> Slip may be considered as the difference between the speed of the vessel and the speed of the engine. It is always expressed as a percentage.

        <div style="margin-left: 30px;">
            <strong class="pastExperns">(i) Optimum trim</strong>
            <br> Most ships are designed to carry a certain amount of cargo at a designated speed, consuming a certain amount of fuel under a <strong>specified trim condition</strong>. Trim optimisation has significant economic benefits in terms of fuel savings. It should be emphasised that even small trim changes can have a large impact on vessel performance.
            <br>
            <br>

            <strong>The change in ship trim</strong> is achieved via cargo load planning and a ballasting plan when in port. Nowadays, <strong>loading computers</strong> provide additional functionality for the representation of trim, optimal trim and loading options to achieve the optimal trim. Trim linked to a loading computer helps the deck officers to achieve a better loading plan and optimal trim.
            <br>
            <br> Based on what has been described in this section, the following may be stated:
            <ol>
                <li>Trim could influence ship fuel consumption significantly, with the evidence showing up to 0.5 % to 3% of savings.</li>
                <li>Trim impact is the result of changes to ship hydrodynamics and thereby ship resistances.</li>
                <li>For every ship, there is an optimal trim that will give minimal ship resistances and maximise fuel efficiency.</li>
                <li>The optimum trim is a function of ship speed and draft. </li>
                <li>To achieve optimal trim, due consideration should be given to ship loading and its load planning. </li>
                <li>Ballast water, and to some extent bunker fuel, may be used to trim the vessel. </li>
                <li>Most loading computers on-board provide functionalities and trim tables to achieve the desirable ship trim. </li>
                <li>It is difficult to measure the actual saving levels due to trim while the ship is underway due to impact of other operational conditions (speed, draft, weather and sea impacts).</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <strong class="pastExperns">(ii) Optimum ballast</strong>
            <br> Ships normally carry ballast water to ensure ship’s stability and safety. Normally, ballast levels should be adjusted, taking the requirements into account to meet ship stability, steering aspects of the ship and <strong>optimum trim</strong>. This does not necessarily mean carrying lots of ballast water all the time. This unnecessarily increases the ship displacement that directly increases fuel consumption. Thus, there is an optimum ballast condition that needs to be achieved through good cargo planning as well as voyage planning.
            <br>
            <br>

            <strong class="pastExperns">(iii) Optimum use of rudder and autopilot</strong>
            <br> Autopilot is the use of an automatic system to control the rudder on the vessel. Use of autopilot can reduce the fuel consumption by smoothing out the large angle rudder movements used to hold a steady course. Efficient and adaptive autopilot operations allow small deviations to course-line, but will use fewer and smaller angle rudder movements to maintain the course-line. This decreases the rudder movement and consequently reduces fuel consumption.
